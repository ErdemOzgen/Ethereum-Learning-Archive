# Ethereum Basics

## [Denominations](https://ethdocs.org/en/latest/ether.html)

Ethereum’s currency unit is called ether, identified also as "ETH" or with the symbols Ξ (from the Greek letter "Xi" that looks like a stylized capital E) or, less often, diamonds: for example, 1 ether, or 1 ETH, or Ξ1, or diamonds 1.
Use Unicode character U+039E for Ξ and U+2666 for diamonds.
